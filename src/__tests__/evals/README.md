# Evals

LLM eval suite for tool-use quality. Six suites run the same 16 cases and
the same three models (Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT 5.4, Gemini 3 Flash) but with
different tool sets and system prompts:

| Suite name                | Tools available                             | System prompt                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `search_replace`          | `search_replace` only                       | Minimal custom "precise code editor" prompt   |
| `search_replace_few`      | `search_replace` only                       | Variant prompt encouraging fewer tool calls   |
| `edit_file`               | `edit_file` only                            | Minimal custom `edit_file` prompt             |
| `basic_agent`             | `search_replace`, `write_file`              | Production `LOCAL_AGENT_BASIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT`  |
| `pro_agent`               | `search_replace`, `edit_file`, `write_file` | Production `LOCAL_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (Pro)  |
| `pro_agent_experimental`  | `search_replace`, `edit_file`, `write_file` | Editable copy of the Pro prompt for tweaking  |

Each case gives the model a real source file plus an editing instruction,
runs the model with the suite's tools wired up, applies the produced edits,
and then asks an LLM judge (GPT 5.4) whether the result satisfies the
instruction.

## Prerequisites

All models are routed through the Dyad Engine gateway, so you only need one
credential: a Dyad Pro API key, exposed as `DYAD_PRO_API_KEY`. The
`edit_file` tool additionally calls the engine's `/tools/turbo-file-edit`
endpoint to apply sketched edits — that uses the same key.

The suite is skipped entirely when `DYAD_PRO_API_KEY` is unset — no tests will
fail, they just won't run. This keeps regular `vitest run` safe for contributors
without a key.

Export the key for the session (plus the two required filter vars — see
[Running the suite](#running-the-suite)):

```bash
export DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..."
EVAL_SUITE=all EVAL_MODEL=all npm run eval
```

Or set everything inline for a single command:

```bash
DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." EVAL_SUITE=all EVAL_MODEL=all npm run eval
```

Optional: override the gateway URL with `DYAD_ENGINE_URL` (defaults to
`https://engine.dyad.sh/v1`).

## Running the suite

**Both `EVAL_SUITE` and `EVAL_MODEL` are required.** A full run of every
suite against every model is expensive, so the suite will not run unless
the caller opts in explicitly. If either variable is unset, the eval prints
a warning describing how to configure it and registers a single skipped
placeholder — it does not fail CI, but it also does not run any cases.

Use the special value `all` to mean "run everything":

```bash
# Run every suite against every model against every case.
EVAL_SUITE=all EVAL_MODEL=all DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." npm run eval
```

**Heads up — this is expensive.** A full `all`/`all` run issues one
generation per (suite × model × case) triple plus one judge call per case,
across 6 suites, 3 models, and 16 cases. The `edit_file`, `pro_agent`, and
`pro_agent_experimental` suites also make additional engine calls for each
sketched edit the model produces through `edit_file`. Expect dozens of LLM requests, some of which run reasoning
models on 300+ line fixtures. Use sparingly; prefer narrow filters during
development.

### Running a single suite

Set `EVAL_SUITE` to the exact `name` (case-insensitive) of the suite — the
same name that appears as a folder under `eval-results/`. A comma-separated
list runs multiple suites:

```bash
# Just the original search_replace-only suite
EVAL_SUITE=search_replace EVAL_MODEL=all DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." npm run eval

# The basic_agent suite (Basic agent prompt, search_replace + write_file)
EVAL_SUITE=basic_agent EVAL_MODEL=all DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." npm run eval

# The pro_agent suite (Pro agent prompt, search_replace + edit_file + write_file)
EVAL_SUITE=pro_agent EVAL_MODEL=all DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." npm run eval
```

Note: `EVAL_SUITE` matches suite `name`s exactly (case-insensitive), and
accepts a comma-separated list for multiple suites (e.g.
`EVAL_SUITE=search_replace,edit_file`). Unknown names error out with the
available list.

### Running a single case

Vitest's `-t` flag filters by test name. Case names are the `name` field in
the `CASES` array of [tool_use.eval.ts](tool_use.eval.ts).

```bash
EVAL_SUITE=all EVAL_MODEL=all DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." \
  npm run eval -- -t "Extract a helper function"
```

`-t` matches as a substring, so a short unique fragment works too:

```bash
EVAL_SUITE=all EVAL_MODEL=all DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." npm run eval -- -t "zod"
```

### Running against one model

Set `EVAL_MODEL` to a case-insensitive substring of the model's label or
model name. It matches against both, so short fragments like `sonnet`, `gpt`,
or `gemini` work:

```bash
EVAL_SUITE=all EVAL_MODEL=sonnet DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." npm run eval
```

### Combining filters

`EVAL_SUITE`, `EVAL_MODEL`, and `-t` compose. A tight development loop:

```bash
EVAL_SUITE=search_replace EVAL_MODEL=sonnet \
  DYAD_PRO_API_KEY="..." npm run eval -- -t "Extract a helper function"
```

Note: vitest's `-t` pattern is applied across the full describe/test
hierarchy as a regex, which makes "model label > case name" style patterns
brittle across vitest versions. Prefer `EVAL_SUITE` / `EVAL_MODEL` for
suite and model filtering and reserve `-t` for case-name filtering.

## Where results are stored

Every run writes structured output to `eval-results/` at the repo root. The
directory is gitignored and never cleaned automatically — delete old runs by
hand when you want to.

Layout:

```
eval-results/
  <suite-name>/                          ← one top-level folder per suite
    <run-start-ts>__<model-label>/       ← one folder per (run, model)
      <case-name>/                       ← one folder per case
        record.json                      ← full structured record
        record.txt                       ← human-readable render of the same
        details/                         ← per-record split views
          file_before.<ext>              ← file at the start of the run
          file_after.<ext>               ← file at the end of the run
          diff.patch                     ← cumulative unified diff
          system_prompt.txt              ← system prompt sent to the model
          instructions.txt               ← case instructions (no file content)
          user_prompt.txt                ← full user message (file + instructions)
          metadata.json                  ← run metadata without big blobs
          metadata.txt                   ← same info, human-readable
        tool_calls/
          01.txt                         ← combined view of tool call #1
          01/                            ← split view, one piece per file
            file_before.<ext>
            file_after.<ext>
            diff.patch
            meta.txt
            <arg_name>.<ext>             ← one file per tool arg (see below)
          02.txt
          02/
          ...
```

The top-level folder is the suite `name`, so each suite lands in its own
directory:

- `eval-results/search_replace/`
- `eval-results/search_replace_few/`
- `eval-results/edit_file/`
- `eval-results/basic_agent/`
- `eval-results/pro_agent/`
- `eval-results/pro_agent_experimental/`

`<run-start-ts>` is captured once at process start, so every case from the
same `npm run eval` invocation for a given (suite, model) pair clusters into
one folder. Folder names sort chronologically under `ls`.

### Record format

`record.json` contains the complete machine-readable record. Key fields:

- `timestamp`, `suite`, `caseName` — identifying metadata.
- `model` — `{label, provider, modelName, responseModelId}`. `responseModelId`
  is the exact model string the gateway echoed back, which can differ from
  `modelName` (e.g. dated snapshots).
- `prompt` — `{system, instructions, user}`. `system` is the full system
  prompt sent to the model (including the production agent prompts when the
  suite uses one). `instructions` is the bare case instruction — useful for
  scanning what was asked without the fixture file inlined. `user` is the
  full user message actually sent (file content + instructions).
- `file` — `{name, before, after}`. The fixture file name plus its content
  at the start and end of the run. `before` / `after` are also written to
  `details/file_before.<ext>` / `details/file_after.<ext>` for easy editor
  opening with matching syntax highlighting.
- `llm.totalDurationMs`, `llm.totalUsage` — wall-clock time and token totals
  for the model under test (not the judge).
- `llm.requests` — per-step breakdown: each entry is one HTTP round-trip with
  its own duration, usage, and `finishReason`.
- `toolCalls` — every tool call the model made. Each entry records
  `toolName`, `filePath`, an `args` map (keyed by the tool's parameter names,
  so `old_string`/`new_string` for `search_replace`, `content` for
  `write_file`, `content`/`instructions` for `edit_file`), the file before
  and after the call, and a unified diff of just that call.
- `diff` — unified diff from the original fixture to the final file
  (i.e. the cumulative effect of all tool calls).
- `judge` — the judge's verdict: `label`, `modelName`, `durationMs`,
  `usage`, `pass` (boolean), and `explanation` (the judge's written
  reasoning, with the trailing `PASS`/`FAIL` verdict line stripped).
- `passed` — the overall test outcome. Requires the judge to say `PASS` *and*
  all structural checks to pass *and* no exceptions to be thrown.
- `errorMessage` — set when the test threw (tool-call failure, structural
  check failure, judge FAIL, etc.); `null` otherwise.

`record.txt` is a readable render of the same information — headers, the
system prompt and instructions, inline tool-call bodies, usage totals, the
final diff, and the judge's explanation. Open it when you want a quick
human-readable summary instead of parsing JSON.

### The `details/` folder

`details/` is a split view of the record, intended for quick inspection and
diffing without having to parse JSON or scroll through `record.txt`:

- `file_before.<ext>` / `file_after.<ext>` — raw file content before and
  after the run, with the fixture's extension preserved so editors apply
  the right syntax highlighting.
- `diff.patch` — the same unified diff as `record.diff`.
- `system_prompt.txt`, `instructions.txt`, `user_prompt.txt` — the three
  views of the prompt input.
- `metadata.json` / `metadata.txt` — everything from `record.json` minus the
  large content blobs that already have their own files (no inline file
  contents and no per-tool-call entries). Useful for skimming token counts,
  judge verdict, and model identity across many runs.

### The `tool_calls/` folder

One `NN.txt` (combined view) and one `NN/` folder (split view) per tool
call. The split view contains the raw pieces as standalone files:

- `file_before.<ext>`, `file_after.<ext>`, `diff.patch` — file state around
  the single call.
- `meta.txt` — timestamp, tool name, target path, and per-arg length summary.
- One file per tool argument, named after the arg's key. String args use the
  target file's extension (for syntax highlighting); non-string args become
  JSON blobs. So a `search_replace` call produces `old_string.ts` and
  `new_string.ts`; a `write_file` call produces `content.ts` and
  `description.ts`; an `edit_file` call produces `content.ts` and
  `instructions.ts`.
